# CLIService
A simple command line interface suitable for embedded applications written in C++.

Use the config, build, run and clean scripts to run the example application on Linux, Mac or Windows.

To use the CLIService on an embedded platform, implement the OIStreamIf to read and write from the serial port of your device.
